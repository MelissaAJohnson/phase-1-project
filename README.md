# Show Search
Show Search is a simple app that allows you to find the shows everyone is talking about. Simply enter a search term to find shows matching the title with details on how to watch it. Show details include the network, show dates and time, whether its still running or not, genre, and a link to the show's site.

## Technical Details
Show Search was created to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills including:
- Using CSS to style site sections.
- Using Javascript to respond to user input including `addEventListener`, `querySelector`, and other actions based on form input and button clicks.
- Using Javascript to retrieve results from [TV Maze](https://tvmaze.com) - a good show search API.
- Using Javascript object iteration to manipulate the DOM to display search results.
## Known Issues
Because this is an MVP release, there a number of issues you may encounter.
- If the show summary is multiple paragrahs, it will cause summary paragraphs to wrap under the show image.
- Searching by actors could be added.
- It would be helpful to display show ratings in a graphical format.
